## Instructor: [Jeremy McPeak][instructor url]

As a developer, there are few things more exciting than new versions of your chosen language. We spend a lot of time writing and working with code, and every new version brings new syntax and other goodies that makes working with code even more enjoyable than it already is. PHP 7 and 7.1 are no exception.

In this course, Jeremy McPeak will take you through each of the new language features in PHP 7 and 7.1. Jeremy will get you up to speed with the latest and greatest for the PHP language, with practical examples of each new feature.
